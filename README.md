# Wordle

Welcome to **Wordle**, a simple and fun word-guessing game implemented in Python using Visual Studio Code! This project was created as the final assignment for the **Programming I** course in Computer Engineering for Java, and I trqanslated and optimized for Python.

## ðŸ“– Description

**Wordle** is a word puzzle game where players must guess a 5-letter target word within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback using colors to indicate how close the guess is to the target word:

- **Gray**: The letter is not in the target word.
- **Yellow**: The letter is in the target word but in the wrong position.
- **Green**: The letter is in the target word and in the correct position.

The goal is to guess the target word before running out of attempts. The game also tracks statistics of past games, which can be reviewed at any time.
